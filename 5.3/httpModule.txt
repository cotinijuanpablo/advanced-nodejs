There are five major classes in the http module
-http.Server to create the servers, inherits from net.server so Event Emitter
-http.ServerResponse gets created internally by http server
-http.Agent class is used to manage pooling sockets use in client request
    -we can create one with different optiosn than the default glboal
-http.ClientRequest, when we initiate a client request
-http.IncomingMessage is what we see server side

ServerResponse and ClientRequest implement WritableStream Interface, so EventEmitter

IncomingMessage implement ReadableStream Interface, also EventEmitter.
